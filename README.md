# Phylogenetic and gene synteny analysis of the TPS gene across plants and microbes
TPS gene sequences collected from various microbes and plants into the "sequence_data" file;

Newick format of phylogenetic trees into the "Newick_format_of_phylogenetic_trees" file;

Raw data is used to regenerate the gene synteny network into the "Raw_data" file.
